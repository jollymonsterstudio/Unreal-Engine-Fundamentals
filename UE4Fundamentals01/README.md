# Unreal C++ Tutorial 
### Player Character Series – Punch – Part 5 - Play Sounds

Hey guys,

This is the fifth video our Player Character series taking about sounds.

The topics we are going to cover in this tutorial are:
* [USoundCue - xx:xx]() - we are going to attach our WAV file to a sound cue and bring that into our code.
* [UAudioComponent - xx:xx]() - we are then going to tie our sound cue to our audio component to be able to handle playback.
* [Playing sounds - xx:xx]() - we are going trigger the playing of the sounds and adjusting their pitch to introduce a bit of variance.
